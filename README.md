# araig-flightsim-console

This console app was developed as part of an applied research project between the School of Aviation and School of ICT at Seneca College to develop an 
experimental shell program that could control a VR suit called ARAIG (this version does not directly interface with the suit) during the OOP in C++ course in 
the Bachelor of Technology program. The program reads in data from csv files that describe ARAIG stimulation and sensor readings, as well as data from a profile 
file that states the order of execution for tasks to run for the suit. This project has a strong focus on OOP principles and C++ features such as STL containers, 
operator overloading, the rule of 5, etc.
